Place docs you'd like to transform in the old_docs folder.

Use this script to walk through all docs put in the `old_docs` directory

Will go through all mdx files to transform any string / phrase specified in the transform function (and copy other relevant files over)

Transformed docs will be output in the `new_docs` folder
